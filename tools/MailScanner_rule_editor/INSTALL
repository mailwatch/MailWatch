INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------

If you're using the RPM-based MailScanner install:

# cp msre_reload.sh /usr/local/bin

# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/msre_reload.sh

It is used by the MSRE cron job to restart MailScanner after a rule has been edited.

If you've used a source-based install of MailScanner, you'll need to create a msre_reload.sh
script which reloads mailscanner in your environment.
