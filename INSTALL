-------------------------
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

MailWatch for MailScanner is developed on RedHat 9 & RHEL 3.0, so these docs will reflect this and I will make note on anything that will be required to run on other distro's or operating systems.

BEFORE YOU START

You must have a working MailScanner set-up and have running copies of MySQL, Apache, PHP (with MySQL and GD support) and for MailScanner to be able to use a database you need Perl DBI and DBD::mysql;
you also need Perl Encoding::FixLatin to deal with email subjects that contain characters in more than one encoding.

SUPPORT

Please use the mailing-list mailwatch-users@lists.sourceforge.net or the forums on Sourceforge. Note that you will get faster support from me if you use the mailing-list.

NOTES FOR OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS/LINUX DISTRO'S

PHP should have the following set in php.ini (possibly others too....)
 safe_mode = Off
 register_globals = Off
 magic_quotes_gpc = Off
 magic_quotes_runtime = Off
 session.auto_start = 0

INSTALLATION

All commands below should be run as the 'root'.

----------------------------------------------------------- 
Create the database
-----------------------------------------------------------
# mysql < create.sql 

NOTE: you will need to modify the above as necessary for your system if you have a root password for your MySQL database (recommended!) - RH9 is blank by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a MySQL user and password & Set-up MailScanner for SQL logging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# mysql
mysql> GRANT ALL ON mailscanner.* TO mailwatch@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
mysql> GRANT FILE ON *.* TO mailwatch@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '<password>'; 
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Edit MailScanner_perl_scripts/MailWatch.pm and change the $db_user and $db_pass values accordingly and move MailWatch.pm to /usr/lib/MailScanner/MailScanner/CustomFunctions (this could be /opt/MailScanner/lib/MailScanner/MailScanner/CustomFunctions on non-RPM systems).

---------------------------------------------------
Create a MailWatch web user
---------------------------------------------------

# mysql mailscanner -u mailwatch -p
Enter password: ******
mysql> INSERT INTO users SET username = '<username>', password = md5('<password>'), fullname = '<name>', type ='A' 

----------------------------------------------------
Install & Configure MailWatch
----------------------------------------------------

- Move the mailscanner directory to the web server's root.

# mv mailscanner /var/www/html/

- Check the permissions of /var/www/html/mailscanner/images and /var/www/html/mailscanner/images/cache - they should be ug+rwx and owned by root and in the same group as the web server user (apache on RedHat 9).

# chown root:apache images
# chmod ug+rwx images
# chown root:apache images/cache
# chmod ug+rwx images/cache

- Check the permissions of /var/www/html/mailscanner/temp - they should be ug+rw and owned by root and in the same group as the web server user (apache on RedHat 9).

# chown root:apache temp
# chmod ug+rw temp

- Create conf.php by copying conf.php.example and edit the values to suit, you will need to set DB_USER and DB_PASS to the MySQL user and password that you created earlier.

   Note that MailWatch 1.0 can use the quarantine more effectively when used
   with MailScanner version 4.43 or later as Julian added some code for me
   to keep track of messages quarantined by using a flag in the maillog table.
   This means that MailWatch 1.0 is *much* faster when you have a large
   quarantine directory. The new quarantine report requires the use of the
   new functionality - so you must upgrade if you want to run this.

   The new quarantine flag is used by default and you must disable
   the clean.quarantine script supplied by MailScanner and use the new
   quarantine_maint.php script in the tools/Cron_jobs directory instead.
   To clean the quarantine - set 'QUARANTINE_DAYS_TO_KEEP' in conf.php and
   run './quarantine_maint --clean'. This should then be run daily from cron.

   If you are still using MailScanner 4.42 or older, updating your installation
   is highly recommanded; if you can't update you need to set the QUARANTINE_USE_FLAG
   to false in conf.php and use the clean.quarantine script supplied by MailScanner.

# cp conf.php.example conf.php

------------------------------------------------------------ 
Set-up MailScanner
------------------------------------------------------------

- Stop MailScanner

# service MailScanner stop

Next edit /etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf - you need to make sure that the following options are set:

 Always Looked Up Last = &MailWatchLogging
 Detailed Spam Report = yes
 Quarantine Whole Message = yes
 Quarantine Whole Messages As Queue Files = no
 Include Scores In SpamAssassin Report = yes
 Quarantine User = root
 Quarantine Group = apache (this should be the same group as your web server)
 Quarantine Permissions = 0660

Spam Actions and High Scoring Spam Actions should also have 'store' as one of the keywords if you want to quarantine items for learning/viewing in MailWatch.

If you want to use the integrate Blacklist/Whitelist (optional):

   then edit the file and change the connection string in the CreateList subroutine to match MailWatch.pm.

Copy SQLBlackWhiteList.pm from the folder MailScanner_perl_scripts to /usr/share/MailScanner/MailScanner/CustomFunctions and in MailScanner.conf set:
 Is Definitely Not Spam = &SQLWhitelist
 Is Definitely Spam = &SQLBlacklist

Then edit SQLBlackWhitelist.pm and change the connection string in the 
CreateList subroutine to match MailWatch.pm.

On Debian, new &SQL modules need Perl Encoding::FixLatin lib who is not packaged on Debian/Ubuntu. If Mailscanner crash at restart, install the Perl lib manualy via CPAN (http://www.cpan.org).

- Move the Bayesian Databases and set-up permissions (skip this if you don't use bayes).

Edit /etc/MailScanner/spam.assassin.prefs.conf and set:

bayes_path /etc/MailScanner/bayes/bayes
bayes_file_mode 0660

Create the 'new' bayes directory, make the directory owned by the same group as the web server user and make the directory setgid:

# mkdir /etc/MailScanner/bayes
# chown root:apache /etc/MailScanner/bayes
# chmod g+rws /etc/MailScanner/bayes

Copy the existing bayes databases and set the permissions:

# cp /root/.spamassassin/bayes_* /etc/MailScanner/bayes
# chown root:apache /etc/MailScanner/bayes/bayes_*
# chmod g+rw /etc/MailScanner/bayes/bayes_*

Test SpamAssassin to make sure that it is using the new databases correctly:

# spamassassin -D -p /etc/MailScanner/spam.assassin.prefs.conf --lint

and you should see soomething like:

debug: using "/etc/MailScanner/spam.assassin.prefs.conf" for user prefs file
debug: bayes: 28821 tie-ing to DB file R/O /etc/MailScanner/bayes/bayes_toks
debug: bayes: 28821 tie-ing to DB file R/O /etc/MailScanner/bayes/bayes_seen
debug: bayes: found bayes db version 2
debug: Score set 3 chosen.

- Start MailScanner up again.

# service MailScanner start && tail -f /var/log/maillog

You should see something like:

Jun 13 12:18:23 hoshi MailScanner[26388]: MailScanner E-Mail Virus Scanner version 4.20-3 starting...
Jun 13 12:18:24 hoshi MailScanner[26388]: Config: calling custom init function MailWatchLogging
Jun 13 12:18:24 hoshi MailScanner[26388]: Initialising database connection
Jun 13 12:18:24 hoshi MailScanner[26388]: Finished initialising database connection

Congratulations - you now have MailScanner logging to MySQL.

If you want to see the output of `MailScanner --lint` in Tools/MailScanner Lint (Test) edit conf.php and set MS_EXECUTABLE_PATH,
the follow instruction in tools/sudo/INSTALL

-------------------------------------------
Database cleanup of maillog records
-------------------------------------------

add db_clean.php from folder tools/Cron_jobs to /etc/cron.daily/

You will then to edit conf.php the RECORD_DAYS_TO_KEEP definition.
You will need to edit the db_clean.php to reflect the location of the mailscanner/functions.php file

--------------------------------------------
Quarantine Maintenance
--------------------------------------------

Remove the clean.quarantine cronjob configured with MailScanner.

Edit and copy quarantine_maint.sh from folder tools/Cron_jobs to /etc/cron.daily/

You will then to edit conf.php the QUARANTINE_DAYS_TO_KEEP definition.
You will need to edit the quarantine_maint.sh to reflect the location of the quarantine_maint.php file.
You will need to edit the quarantine_maint.php to reflect the location of the functions.php file

--------------------------------------------
Quarantine Reporting
--------------------------------------------

Add quarantine_report.php from folder tools/Cron_jobs to /etc/cron.daily

You will need to edit the quarantine_report.php to reflect the location of the functions.php file

------------------------------------------------- 
Test the MailWatch interface
-------------------------------------------------

Point your browser to http://<hostname>/mailscanner/ - you should be prompted for a username and password - enter the details of the MailWatch web user that you created earlier, and you should see a list of the last 50 messages processed by MailScanner.

- Update the SpamAssassin Rules table

MailWatch keeps a list of all the SpamAssassin rules and descriptions which are displayed on the 'Message Detail' page - to show the descriptions, you need to run the updater every time you add new rules or upgrade SpamAssassin.

Click on the 'Other' menu and select 'Update SpamAssassin Rule Descriptions' and click 'Run Now'.

- Update the GeoIP database 

Click on the 'Other' menu and select 'Update GeoIP database' and click 'Run Now'.

- Setup the Mail Queue watcher (optional)

You can get MailWatch to watch and display your sendmail queue directories - all you need to do is copy mailq.php (from the root of the mailwatch tarball - not from the mailscanner directory - they are different!) to /usr/local/bin and set-up a cron-job to run it.

----------------------------------------------------------
Optional for items Sendmail
----------------------------------------------------------

Edit mailq.php first to change the require line to point to the location of functions.php, then:
# cp tools/Sendmail_queue/mailq.php /usr/local/bin
# crontab -e
0-59 * * * * 	/usr/local/bin/mailq.php

Note: mailq.php re-creates all entries on each run, so for busy sites you will probably want to change this to run every 5 minutes or greater.

- Setup the Sendmail Relay Log watcher (optional)

You can get MailWatch to watch your sendmail logs and store all message relay information which is then displayed on the 'Message Detail' page which helps debugging and makes it easy for a Helpdesk to actually see where a message was delivered to by the MTA and what the response back was (e.g. the remote queue id etc.).

# cp tools/Sendmail_relay/sendmail_relay.php /usr/local/bin
# cp tools/Sendmail_relay/sendmail_relay.init /etc/rc.d/init.d/
# chmod 777 /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail_relay.init
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail_relay.init start
# ln -s /etc/rc.d/ini.d/sendmail_relay.init /etc/rc.2/S30sendmail_relay.init

----------------------------------------------------------
Optional for item Postfix
----------------------------------------------------------

----- Adding Postfix relay information

- Add the table to the database

# mysql -p mailscanner < tools/Postfix_relay/create_relay_postfix.sql

- Edit the parser and add it as an hourly cron job

Edit the parser for location of mailwatch webpages

Edit mailscanner_relay.php in the mailscanner folder


----------------------------------------------------------
Optional for MailScanner Rule Editor
----------------------------------------------------------

Make sure MailWatch's conf.php has the following lines at the end
(amend as appropriate)

----------------------------------------------------------
// Enable MailScanner Rule Editor
define('MSRE', true);
define('MSRE_RELOAD_INTERVAL', 5);
define('MSRE_RULESET_DIR', "/etc/MailScanner/rules");
----------------------------------------------------------

Change file permissions so that we can update the rules
change group and rules directory locations as appropriate

chgrp -R apache /etc/MailScanner/rules
chmod g+rwxs /etc/MailScanner/rules
chmod g+rw /etc/MailScanner/rules/*.rules

See also the INSTALL docs in tools/MailScanner_rule_editor
and tools/Cron_jobs

------------------------------------------------------------ FINISHED!! (Phew!)

Please send any errors or omissions to the mailing-list or directly to me.

Thanks!
Steve.
