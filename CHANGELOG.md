 - User Management (create users GUI) with better filtering to allow per-user/per-domain support.
 - Audit logging
 - XML-RPC web services for running multiple MailScanner/MailWatch boxes with a single database allowing quarantine
   view/release from any front-end.
 - Enhanced reporting of MTA deliveries/rejections - the total mail by date will report unkown user, RBL, unknown domain
   rejection (sendmail only).
 - Better query builder for reports - allows you to select the same row more than once to do things like
   (date >= yyyy-mm-dd AND date <= yyyy-mm-dd), you can also use MySQL functions by putting a '!' in front e.g. DATE is
   equal to !CURRENT_DATE() will always return today's date. You can also save common queries for reuse again.

   links to MailWatch to view/release.)
 - Integrated Blacklist/Whitelist - allow you to maintain per-user/per-domain/global blacklist/whitelists.

   clamavmodule' would activate the regexp for SophosSAVI.
 - New 'Virus Report' allows comparison of multiple scanners (if you run more than one) and allows you to see 1st
   detection date/time of each virus by each scanner.

## 0.4
 - Changed index on maillog table for *much* greater performance.

 - Fixed a bug in mailq.php that caused it not to work on earlier PHP versions.
 - Updated rep_total_mail_by_date.php to include spam and virus percentage.

 - Added new config variable SA_PREFS which allow you to specify the location of spam.assassin.prefs.conf if it isn't in
   the usual place.
 - Changed MySQL 'INSERT DELAYED' statement in MailWatch.pm back to the original 'INSERT' as this caused MailScanner to
   'hang' with 99.9% CPU occasionally (MySQL 3.2) on one of my systems - those who are running MySQL >4 would probably
   be okay to change this back to 'INSERT DELAYED' if you have a high-volume site and wish to spare a few MailScanner
   cycles.
 - Exim reports the connecting MTA IP Address as ip.ip.ip.ip.port - updated MailWatch.pm to strip off the port as
   necessary before insert to the DB.
 - Changed the Message Detail page to display the IP Addresses of each MTA recorded in the 'Received' headers and allow
   checks of each with OpenRBL.
 - Added a new setting: DISTRIBUTED_SETUP which when set 'hides' any items that do not work in a distributed environment
   (several servers recording to one MailWatch database) - thanks to Stijn Jonker for this.
 - Added a new tool for sendmail users (patches for other MTA's are welcome) which watches the maillog for message relay
   information and records it to a new table named 'relay' - this information is then displayed on the Message Detail
   screen and shows the Date/Time, Relayed From, Relayed To and Status of each relay that handled a message - thanks to
   Chris Campbell for the idea (it *very* handy for Helpdesks).
 - Added new quarantine settings - QUARANTINE_FROM_ADDR, QUARANTINE_SUBJECT and QUARANTINE_MSG_BODY for a released quarantine message.
 - Changed the SA-Learn option in the quarantine to be more verbose when an error is returned.
 - Added the display of Load Average to the page headers - this will work automatically on any system that has /proc/load_avg available.
 - Fixed the regex that picks out the SpamAssassin rules from the spam report to be case-insensitive as this didn't work for some because of this.
 - Fixed the display of the spam report if SpamAssasin timed-out when processing a message (it was not displayed).
 - Fixed msconfig.php to expand MailScanner.conf %var% - thanks to Chris Maynard for the patch for this.
 - Speeded up the display and order of data in quarantine.php.
 - Message Listing report now uses a Google-style pager.
 - Fixed SQL statement in Top Virus Report speeding it up slightly.
 - Fixed the SQL ORDER BY on the Recent Messages page.
 - Removed the display of the Message ID on the Recent Messages page to allow more space for the other fields.
 - Removed the display of Host (the host that processed the message) when not running in DISTRIBUTED_SETUP mode to allow more space for the other fields.
 - Changed the display colour of High Scoring spam on the Recent Messages page.

## 0.3beta
 - New MailWatch.pm file that contains the MailWatch SQL Logging code.
 - Changed the SQL Logging procedure names from SQLLogging to MailWatchLogging to save confusion as to which versions
   people are using.

   MailScanner.
